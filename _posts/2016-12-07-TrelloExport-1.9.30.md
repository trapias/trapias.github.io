New CSS and options to format HTML exported files.

## What's new for TrelloExport 1.9.30?

A couple of bugs should be fixed, and the HTML export was improved a little.

We have a new option to turn on and off the exporting of cards' creation date and creator into the HTML (and Markdown too), and a new CSS to improve formatting.


![TrelloExport 1.9.30]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/TrelloExport_1.9.30.png)

The new CSS produces this kind of output:

![HTML sample output]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/TrelloExport_html.png)


Suggestions about how to improve formatting are welcome.
