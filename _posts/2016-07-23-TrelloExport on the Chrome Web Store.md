Starding today, TrelloExport is available on the Chrome Web Store.

## What's TrelloExport?
It's a Chrome extension that allows you to export data from your Trello boards to Excel, Markdown, HTML and OPML files.
Once installed, you will find a new option in Trello right sidebar under More > Print and Export:

![How to launch]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/TrelloExport__run.png)

Clicking TrelloExport there, you will be shown the export dialog, by which you can decide what and how to export:

Please see other posts on this site for more details and features.


## Going to the store
After a long time, I decided to push TrelloExport to the Chrome Web Store: you can now find it on store and install from there, without the need to download from Github and manually do a local install.

Go to the store at the following URL to grab it (it is not yet visible if you search for it, but I guess it will in a few days):

[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/trelloexport/kmmnaeamjfdnbhljpedgfchjbkbomahp](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/trelloexport/kmmnaeamjfdnbhljpedgfchjbkbomahp)



## Feedback
