| Version 1.9.38 introduces support for the [Trello Custom Fields Power-Up](https://blog.trello.com/trello-custom-fields). â€Ÿ _The Custom Fields Power-Up allows you to create additional fields for this board that you and your team can set on cards. For example, you might want to add a date field that can be used to store when work was started on a particular card. You can toggle whether these fields should show up on the front of cards providing more glanceable information._  | ![Custom Fields]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/customfieldspowerup.png) |
| With this power-up you can add custom fields to any board, choosing among some field types: |  ![Custom Fields]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/customfieldstypes.png) |

TrelloExport will add those custom fields as columns to your Excel report: just check to export CustomFields, and you will see new columns listed in the dropdown.
