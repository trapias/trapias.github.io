New look!

## A brand new look

TrelloExport 1.9.53 does not introduce any new features, except for the new options dialog look.

The new dialog is built with [Tingle](https://robinparisi.github.io/tingle/), a nice and lightweight modal plugin: isn't it cool?

## ...and a sponsor

As you might have noticed, there’s a a new area in the dialog’s footer: that’s for TrelloExport new sponsor:

I'm developing TrelloExport with love, and know it helps quite some people out there. I'm adding new features everytime I can, I have plans for it... but there are times when you might need something more, sooner.

That's where [Bridge24](https://bridge24.com/trello/?afmc=1w) comes in: it features a set of very interesting functions to improve your Trello-based workflow, such as exporting data, generating charts and reports, editing cards and more.

Give it a try!
