TrelloExport is a Chrome extension to export data from Trello to Excel, Markdown, HTML and now OPML.

## Exporting to OPML
With version 1.9.23 TrelloExport has a new feature, exporting to OPML files.
 	
[OPML](http://dev.opml.org/) is an XML-based format that allows exchange of outline-structured information between applications running on different operating systems and environments.

## What's new
A new export format is now available, just choose OPML in the "export to" dropdown:

This will export the selected Trello data to an XML-based file:

Then it's up to you what to do with the file: for example you could edit with such a wonderful outliner as Omnigroup's [Omnioutliner](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner):
