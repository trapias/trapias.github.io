New features for Excel and HTML exports!


## What's new for TrelloExport 1.9.34?

Versions 1.9.33 and .34, released today, bring some new features:

- new data field dateLastActivity exported ([issue #18](https://github.com/trapias/TrelloExport/issues/18))
- new data field numberOfComments exported ([issue #19](https://github.com/trapias/TrelloExport/issues/19))
- new option to choose which columns to export to Excel ([issue #17](https://github.com/trapias/TrelloExport/issues/17))
- can set a custom css for HTML export
- can check/uncheck all columns to export


### Excel columns chooser

You can now choose which columns to export to the final Excel spreadsheet:

### HTML custom stylesheet

Perhaps not the better way, but it is now possible to use a custom stylesheet when exporting to HTML: just set the URL to your css file in the box before exporting.
If not specified, the [default stylesheet](https://trapias.github.io/assets/TrelloExport/default.css) will be used.
